Hello World

I am Michael and i'm going to be utilizing GitHub to upload my projects for a portfolio basis. I have been practicing SQL, Python, HTML, C# and JavaScript. I will also be trying my hand in C++, CSS, AWS, VBA (Excel Macros). Plenty of programs to practice, learn, rinse and repeat. I'm excited to start my new adventure and look forward to (much) needed assistance along the way. More scripts to come. This I promise.
